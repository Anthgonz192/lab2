# cyb-101
IDX Environment Template for CodePath Cyber 101 Course

## Setup
1. Wait a few moments for the environment to load.
2. Open the terminal.  You have 2 options:
  - Option 1: Click and drag up from the bottom of the screen to open the terminal
  - Option 2: Keyboard Shortcut:
    - Mac: Command + backtick (the key above the tab key)
    - Windows: Ctrl + backtick (the key above the tab key)
    - Linux: Ctrl + backtick (the key above the tab key)
3. On the right side, click to open the terminal labeled `docker [onStart]`.  We'll use both terminals, but the `docker` terminal is the one we'll use the most, since this is our ubuntu system running in a docker container.
4. The image will take a few minutes to download on the first run. Subsequent starts will be faster.
