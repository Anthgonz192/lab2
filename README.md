# cyb-101
IDX Environment Template for CodePath Cyber 101 Course

## Setup
1. Wait a few moments for the environment to load.
2. Click and drag up from the bottom of the screen to open the terminal
3. On the right side, click to open the terminal labeled `docker [onStart]`.  We'll use both terminals, but the `docker` terminal is the one we'll use the most, since this is our ubuntu system running in a docker container.
4. The image will take a few minutes to download on the first run. Subsequent starts will be faster.
